## TensorFlow RNN Tutorial
- we’ll provide a short tutorial for training a RNN for speech recognition; we’re including code snippets throughout, and you can find the accompanying https://github.com/silicon-valley-data-science/RNN-Tutorial
- if you are brand new to RNNs, we highly recommend you read Christopher Olah’s excellent overview of RNN Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/
- Speech recognition in the past and today both rely on decomposing sound waves into frequency and amplitude using fourier transforms, yielding a spectrogram
